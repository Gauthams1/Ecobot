# Navigation of EcoBot Using Modified ARIMA Model
* Modified ARIMA model for robust navigation of the EcoBot.
* Used for the navigation of a line following bot, designed with low computation requirements.
* Using the modified parameters, achieved a better control and reduced the oscillations even in high speed sharp turns; compensatederrors of conventional PID Algorithm.
